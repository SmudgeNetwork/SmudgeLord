# TgBot(SmudgeLord :3)
A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

A simple group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved into becoming a basis for modular
bots aiming to provide simple plugin expansion via a simple drag and drop.

## Starting the bot.

Once you've setup your database and your configuration (see below) is complete, simply run:

`python3 -m tg_bot`
