A modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Can be found as [Smudge](https://SmudgeLordBOT) on Telegram.

A group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved into becoming a basis for modular
bots aiming to provide simple plugin expansion via a simple drag and drop.

I'm based on [Haruka Aya](https://t.me/HarukaAyaBot),
