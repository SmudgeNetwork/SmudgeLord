# SmudgeLord :3
I'm based on [Haruka Aya](https://t.me/HarukaAyaBot), a modular Telegram Python3 bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

A simple group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved into becoming a basis for modular
bots aiming to provide simple plugin expansion via a simple drag and drop.

Thanks For:
- FFBot - For translations modules.
- Nuno Penim - For Combot Anti Spam System API, GitHub API etc...
- Corsicanu - For Samsung Firmware commands
- TheRealPhoenixBot - For Chatbot(IA)

## Starting the bot.

Once you've setup your database and your configuration (see below) is complete, simply run:

`python3 -m smudge`
